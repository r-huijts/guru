# 🚀 Quick Start Guide: Spiritual Wisdom AI Fine-tuning

Welcome to your spiritual AI teacher training journey! This guide will get you up and running with Llama 3.2 fine-tuning in just a few steps using a clean virtual environment.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A fine-tuned Llama 3.2 model that can:
- Answer spiritual and philosophical questions with wisdom
- Provide meditation guidance and life advice
- Share insights on consciousness, mindfulness, and personal growth
- Maintain a consistent, wise teaching style

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.10+ recommended)
- **6GB+ VRAM** for Llama-3.2-3B (or 4GB+ for 1B model)
- **Apple Silicon Mac** with MPS support (or CUDA GPU for other systems)
- **16GB+ System RAM** recommended

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
```bash
# Run the automated setup (creates venv and installs everything)
python3 setup_environment.py
```

### Step 2: Activate Environment
```bash
# Easy activation with helpful info
./activate_venv.sh

# Or manually:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Test the dataset and environment
python test_dataset.py
```

### Step 4: Start Fine-tuning
```bash
# Begin training (will use MPS on Apple Silicon)
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py

# Or with custom options:
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --model unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct --max-length 1024
```

## 🎛️ Training Options

```bash
# Show all available options
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --help

# Common configurations:
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --model unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct  # Smaller model (4GB VRAM)
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --max-length 1024                      # Shorter sequences
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --output ./my_spiritual_model           # Custom output path
```

## 📊 What to Expect

- **Dataset**: 520 high-quality spiritual wisdom examples
- **Training Time**: 30-60 minutes on Apple Silicon
- **Memory Usage**: ~6GB VRAM for 3B model, ~4GB for 1B model
- **Output**: Fine-tuned model ready for spiritual guidance

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues
```bash
# If setup fails, try manual creation:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Use smaller model:
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --model unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct

# Reduce sequence length:
python finetune_llama_unsloth.py --max-length 1024
```

### Package Issues
```bash
# Reinstall problematic packages:
pip install --force-reinstall transformers datasets
```

## 🧘‍♂️ Next Steps

1. **Test Your Model**: The script will automatically test the model after training
2. **Experiment**: Try different prompts and see how your AI teacher responds
3. **Iterate**: Adjust training parameters and retrain if needed
4. **Deploy**: Use your fine-tuned model in applications or chatbots

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Start Small**: Use the 1B model first to test everything works
- **Monitor Memory**: Watch Activity Monitor during training
- **Be Patient**: First run downloads the model (~6GB)
- **Experiment**: Try different spiritual questions after training

Happy training! 🧘‍♂️✨

## 🎉 Next Steps

After successful training:

1. **Share Wisdom**: Test with your own spiritual questions
2. **Deploy**: Convert to GGUF for local inference
3. **Iterate**: Collect feedback and retrain
4. **Expand**: Add more spiritual texts to your dataset
5. **Integrate**: Build a chat interface or API

## 🧘‍♂️ Philosophy

> "The best teacher is not the one who knows the most, but the one who awakens the wisdom that already exists within the student."

Your AI spiritual teacher is designed to:
- Guide rather than dictate
- Inspire contemplation
- Respect diverse spiritual paths
- Encourage inner exploration
- Share timeless wisdom

*May your AI teacher bring wisdom, peace, and enlightenment to all who seek guidance.* ✨ 

## 🎉 Next Steps

After successful training:

1. **Share Wisdom**: Test with your own spiritual questions
2. **Deploy**: Convert to GGUF for local inference
3. **Iterate**: Collect feedback and retrain
4. **Expand**: Add more spiritual texts to your dataset
5. **Integrate**: Build a chat interface or API

## 🧘‍♂️ Philosophy

> "The best teacher is not the one who knows the most, but the one who awakens the wisdom that already exists within the student."

Your AI spiritual teacher is designed to:
- Guide rather than dictate
- Inspire contemplation
- Respect diverse spiritual paths
- Encourage inner exploration
- Share timeless wisdom

python finetune_llama_unsloth.py     # Train your model
python test_dataset.py               # Test dataset
deactivate                           # Exit when done
```

### Managing the Environment
